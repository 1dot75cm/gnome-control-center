1998-06-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	This is used in some subdir Makefile.am tricks.

 	Makefiles.

1998-05-05  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* core-docs/gnome-intro.sgml: added a bit more to the panel;

	* core-docs/Makefile.am (install-data-local): fixed little bug in
	installing help files.

	* core-docs/gnome-intro.sgml: completed the GNOME intro; there are
	many omissions, but it seems OK.  Now I have to proofread it a bit
	and add a mention of panel applets.  I also added all the
	generated HTML files for people who do not have the docbook tools
	installed (this sucks).

	* core-docs/Makefile.am: put core-docs under automake with some
	quickly hacked-up rules for the RH-5.1 release.  I will clean it
	up later; this seems to work and install gnome-intro in a way such
	that the help browser picks it up.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added core-docs

	  though I couldn't find any lex files that this is needed
